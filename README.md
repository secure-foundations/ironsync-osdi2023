This artifact contains two major components:

 * Run LinearDafny to verify our Dafny source and translate it into C++ source. This corresponds primarily to Sec. 7.1 of our paper.
 * Run the benchmarks. This corresponds to Sec. 7.2.

See the following files for directions:

 * `ae-instructions-dafny-verification.md` for the verification step
 * `ae-instrucitons-benchmark-nr.md` for benchmarks of NR
 * `ae-instrucitons-benchmark-cache.md` for benchmarks of SplinterCache

These 3 steps should be doable independently.
